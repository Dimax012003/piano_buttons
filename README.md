An arduino project that you can play music from a buzzer with push buttons
-You will need an arduino,a rotary encoder,a potensiometer,8 leds,10 push buttons,an lcd display,an resistors at least 330omhs to conect the leds in the ground
-There are 2 buttons that closing and opening the system
-There rest 8 buttons are used as sensors and when you push them a different note is performed through the buzzer 
-The rotary encoder is used to change the frequency of the notes and the potensiometer to adjust the volume of the buzzer
-The lsd display you can use it to see the frequency of its note and the note you are playing 
-Also you can use the leds so every time you press a button it will let the current flow through the leds
